## SOC Responsibilities

1. **Preparation & Prevention**

2. **Monitoring & Investigation**  
   - Use SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response).  
   - Categorize threats and prioritize alerts: Low, Medium, High, Critical.  
   - Perform triage and escalate as necessary.  

3. **Response**  
   - Isolate compromised systems.  
   - Terminate malicious processes.

## Types of SOC Model

1. **In-House SOC** : Team formed by the organization by building its own cybersecurity staff. Requires a sufficient budget to support continuity.
2. **Virtual SOC** : No permanent SOC facility; team works remotely.
3. **Co-managed SOC** : Internal SOC staff work together with an external Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP). Coordination is key in this model.
4. **Command SOC**: A central SOC team oversees several smaller SOCs, often across large regions.
